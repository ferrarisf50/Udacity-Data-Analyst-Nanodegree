    "The project is inspired by Kaggle.com competition. The goal is to analyze 1.4 million taxi trips from Jan 2016 to Jun 2016, and explore any factor that affects the trip duration. The dataset I use for this project is the file train.csv provided within the competition. \n",

    "The raw dataset train.csv contains 1458644 trip records. After reading several public EDA  kernels, I noticed there is a portion of unreasonable trips that should be removed from the dataset. I don't have enough information to tell why some extreme trips happen, but in my intuition, I created some criteria to restrict the trips speed distance etc. also use for cleaning the raw data (See the scripts). The cleaned dataset contains 1449431 trip records so I almost removed 10000 rows from the raw training data."

    "My presentation consists of 6 dashboard. The first dashboard is introduction and the last dashboard is references and information. So I create 4 pages of dashboard to describe the story about NYC taxi trip duration with topics to be discussed: geographical view, weather and holidays, time distribution and miscellaneous factors. At the geographical view topic, I choose to plot the pickup location on the map to view where the passengers called for a taxi. The dots are marked in shading color, the deeper color means the longer trip duration. At the weather and holidays topic, I prefer to plot the snow depth and median of trip duration in line chart, in order to easily compare and see the blizzard has a great affect on the trip duration time. At the time distribution topic, I would like to plot square charts with shading color representing the median of trip duration, to visualize a various distribution on different time period. At the last topic, I use both scatter plot and bar chart, intent to show how trip duration varies on other factors."

    "\n",
    "Thanks for Udacity giving me feedbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Feedback 1__: Red-Green colors are not a good choice for using in comparisons since they are not color-blind friendly colors. The people with this disorder are not able to distinguish this two colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Update__: I decide to change the red-green shading into single color shading to avoid this issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Feedback 2__: (Third slide, first graph) Suggestion: I would recommend replacing the label \"count of trip duration\" with \"count of trips\" which is more clear.\n",
